# EyeSense
This document presents the project done in the context of the ME-410 class. It consists in the design and the prototyping of a haptic feedback belt with an ultrasonic sensors collar. The belt indicates at the same time the direction and the distance of the nearest obstacle captured by the sensors. This device, named EYESENSE, has been evaluated in three different scenarios and proved its efficiency in multiple situations.

The code of the protopye is C++ and the interface use Visual Studio.
